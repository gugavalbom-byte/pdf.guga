There are over 400 components in a smartphone, assembled in layers. “We wanted to celebrate the “good ones”, the things we thought were really interesting to emphasise.”</p>

                        <p>The progenitor of all modern transit maps is the 1933 London Underground map created by <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Beck" target="_blank" class="link">Harry Beck</a>. Beck was a technical draughtsman and his original map, drawn in his spare time, was partly inspired by the schematic view of electrical circuits, emphasising the importance of connections and clarity above all else.</p>
